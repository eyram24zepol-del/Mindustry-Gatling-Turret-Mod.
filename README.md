# Automatic Gatling Turret Mod

### Project Description

This is a custom Mindustry mod that introduces a new, highly-configurable turret. The **Automatic Gatling Turret** is designed for high-volume, rapid-fire defense, specializing in shredding enemy swarms.

### Key Features

* **Variable Fire Rate:** The turret "spins up" as it fires, increasing its rate of fire from 1.2 shots per second to a blazing 0.07 shots per second.
* **Tiered Ammunition:** Its effectiveness scales with the resources you supply. Different ammo types increase both the damage and the number of projectiles fired per volley.
* **Grand Tier Ammo:** A special late-game ammo type that adds powerful chain lightning and piercing effects to its projectiles, making it effective against all enemy types.
* **Laser Pointer:** A built-in laser pointer shows you where the turret is aiming, providing a clear visual cue for targeting.
